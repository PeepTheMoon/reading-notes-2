Learn creative problem solving skills and techniques. Also a discussion on the process and theory behind powerful problem solving and creative thinking.

you're either fixing something that's broken or building something when you problem solve.

to be a good problem solver:
1. be open-minded.  
The actual problem you have may be different to the problem you think you have.

What you think is causing the problem may not actually be what is causing the problem.

The best option may be to throw out your solution and start again in a different direction.

Your beliefs on anything and everything could be wrong.

1. be inquisitive, notice things. look for things that stand out, patterns, things that are there that shouldn't be or things that are missing.

1. ask the right questions:
What is it actually doing?

How is it actually doing it?

How effectively is it performing its purpose?

Why is it doing it/ what would happen if it was taken out?

What is it's relationship with other components?

What could I do to test that assumption?

slow down, don't be lazy, dont panic, and make sure you're solving the right problem.

assess it, break the problem down, and test it.
