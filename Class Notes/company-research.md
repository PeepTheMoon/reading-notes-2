Choose 5 companies, develop strategies to engage with them:
- provide 3 bullet point of why I want to work there.

1. New Relic:
-I'd like to work here because of the data focus.  I'm finding that I enjoy the backend of softward development and working with data.  I need more experience with it, but so far that really appreals to me.  

-They pride themselves on the integrity of their work and have amazing partners.  

-Employees seem to really like working there, which says a lot about a company.  I know that I go above and beyond when I enjoy what I'm doing and when a company's values align with my own.

2. Instrument
-Instrument is always involved in very exciting campaigns.  It seems like I would have the opportunity to always be working on new and exciting things that are always completely different from the project that came before and the one will come after.  

-An opportunity to wear many hats and hopefully get a chance to develop my full-stack skills without having to decide one one or the other.  There are elements I enjoy on both sides and I would like the opportunity to continue to explore and learn more full stack implementations.

-I have a degree in marketing and ocmmunications, and this seems like a place where I may have the opportunity to utilize my skills from my degree and previous career in conjunction with my new software development skills.

3. REI
-I have a friend who worked here and has good things to say about it.  He enjoyed the environment and work/life balance which is important to me.

-I enjoy the outdoors and working on developing software for their website and their trails database would be really engaging for me.

-I like their many green initiatives and would like to work at a place with similar values.

4. Zapproved
-Data integrity and data security.   I would love to learn more about this and be involved in data security.

-Has good benefits and high employee morale.

-Also a cloud-based company which I would like more experience in.

5. Autodesk
-Ability to develop software for a wide variety of people and ocmpanies.

-Ability to work in many areas of software development- I would like the ability to wear the hats of both ends of software development.  

-Opportunities for growth and good benefits, as well as good reviews from employees about Autodesk as a workplace and as a company.



Things to do to connect:
- Follow the companies and the most important people associated with them on LinkedIn and Twitter

- Set up google alerts for the companies you want to work for so you are always in touch with what's progressing with them. You can do the same for the CEOs or other important players.

- Engage with these companies and people on social media in a STRATEGIC way.  Always ask yourself what is your end game and what type of response do you want from engaging with them. Generally, you should be positioning yourself as a software development industry expert without drawing attention to yourself as a bootcamper or code newbie. Have an intelligent interaction with these organizations. 

What I'm looking for re: values and non-negotiables:
- Main non-negotiable: income equality for women.  I absolutely will not tolerate wage disparaties.  The compnay I work for needs to be transparent and show a history of income equality for all workers and not favor white and male employees.

- Able to bring my dog to work, please!

- Good benefits package that includes 401k matching program, good health insurance with alternative/naturopathic options included.

- Ability to be flexible regarding where I do my work.  Want ability to travel and still work if I need to and from home if I want to.  Good work/life balance- I d not want to be coding for 10 hours a day.  I want to be able to feel like I have the time to focus on pursuits outside of work.

- Mentorship is important.  I want to be able to learn from others.  I need an environment that welcomes mobbing and pair programming for group learning.

- I need a very diverse work environment. 

- I need opportunity to grow and to be able to learn new skills and a safe environment to fail.

- A mid-sized company will likely give me most of what I'm looking for.
