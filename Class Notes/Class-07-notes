Today the lab has endpoints that are hard-coded: location and hard coded weather.  They are an array of objects.

There's a lot of setup required to work in backend

need to install a list of dependencies to package.json:
npm i express dotenv cors

package.json has npm test to run tests.  Add "start": "node index.js"
when you run npm start from the terminal, it will run node which allows us to touch files in the server or api

run npm i -g nodemon from terminal
this allows you to not have to run nodemon and not have to restart the server every time.  -g means it's global, not local.

to get an eslint rc, type eslint --init 

in index.js, type:
const express = require ('express);
const app = express();

app.get ('/location', (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        //this is an endpoint
        formatted_query: 'Seattle, WA, USA',
        latitude: '47.606210',
        longtitude: '-122.332071',
        });
});
 //there can be many endpoints

app.listen{3001, () => { console.log('...)}}

req= request (clients make requests)
res= response (servers make responses)

use postman to check if backend is working

// wildstar will match everything, very important to put at the bottom.  this means there will always be a match and will return something, like a 404 error, if not found.

app.get('*', (req, res) => ...) to make a fallback response.  This must be at the end or it will stop wherever it's placed in the code.

//res.json is like the return statement.

heroku login deploys the backend.   May need to install heroku cli, triple check!

heroku create starts a heorku app.

heroku will use any available port, and sometimes the one we normally use will not be available.
