python:
objects are called dictionaries in python.  
arrays are called lists

no dot notation in python

you define functions with def

indents are very important- instead of putting them in curly braces, you indent functions and that's how python knows it's a function.  incorrect indentations break the function.

len = length in python.  instead of .length, len is called as a function.
